Assignment 1 : CIS* 3210
October 6, 2017

Christopher Katsaras
Student # 0795555
Assigned port number = 12040


**********************************************
IMPORTANT NOTES:
**********************************************
	Due to the amiguity of the assignment, Dennis said it was okay to "hardcode" the size of the buffer on the backend (server.c), which is a size of 4096.

	client.c can optionally take an argument for buffer size but will also default to 
	4096 if a size is not given.


**********************************************
Compile:
**********************************************

	Type "make" or "make all" to compile both client and server


**********************************************
Remove all executables and intermediate files 
**********************************************

	Type "make clean"


**********************************************
Run:
**********************************************

	Server: 
		Type "./server portnumber" where portnumber is a valid port number (e.g 2300)

	Client: 
		Type "./client hostname:portnumber < textfile" where hostname is a valid hostname and portnumber is a valid port number (e.g chriskatsaras:3000)

		In addition, a buffer size may be passed as a command lin arg.
		e.g "./client hostname:portnumber bufferSize < textfile"


**********************************************
TO RUN CLIENT TESTING SCRIPT:
**********************************************

	I have created a testing script that will run multiple clients at once, this script will have seperate clients send different files to the server.

	FOR LOCALHOST:
		If you are testing on local host, type "python localhost:portnumber"

	FOR LINUX.SOCS.UOGUELPH.CA:
		If you are testing on the University's Linux terminals, "type python script.py servername" where servername is the name of the server. Some examples of SOCS servers are ginny.socs.uoguelph.ca , fred.socs.uoguelph.ca , george.socs.uoguelph.ca. This script has been created to make grading easier for you but if for any reason you are having issues using it, please feel free to message me! :) 


**********************************************
List of text files used in testing script:

	The first 3 files are rather small while eightydays.txt is the large file I used to test performance.
