Compile:

	Type "make" or "make all" to compile both client and server


Remove all executables and intermediate files 
	Type "make clean"


Run:

	Server: Type "./server portnumber" where portnumber is a valid port number (e.g 2300)

	Client: Type "./client hostname:portnumber" where hostname is a valid hostname and portnumber is a valid port number (e.g chriskatsaras:3000)

TO RUN TESTING SCRIPT:

I have created a testing script that will run multiple clients at once, this script will have seperate clients send different files (usually around 1MB each) to the server.

FOR LOCALHOST:
If you are testing on local host, type "python localhost:portnumber"

FOR LINUX.SOCS.UOGUELPH.CA:
If you are testing on the University's Linux terminals, "type python script.py servername" where servername is the name of the server. Some examples of SOCS servers are ginny.socs.uoguelph.ca , fred.socs.uoguelph.ca , george.socs.uoguelph.ca. This script has been created to make grading easier for you but if for any reason you are having issues using it, please feel free to message me! :)
