**********************************************
Compile:
**********************************************

	Type "make" or "make all" to compile both client and server


**********************************************
Remove all executables and intermediate files 
**********************************************

	Type "make clean"


**********************************************
Run:
**********************************************

	Server: 
		Type "./server portnumber" 
		- Where portnumber is a valid port number (e.g 2300)

	Client: 
		type "./client hostname:portnumber chunkSize filenameToWriteTo fileSize filenameLength < filenameToReadFrom"
		- Where hostname is a valid host (e.g chriskatsaras.com)
		- Where portnumber is a valid port number (e.g 2300)
		- Where chunkSize is a valid 8-byte int (e.g 4096)
		- Where filenameToWriteTo is a valid filename (e.g connor.txt)
		- Where fileSize is a valid 8-byte in (e.g 12345678)
		- Where fileNameLength is the length of filenameToWriteTo. This is necessary for the 	  protocol which Dennis instructed us to do in class

**********************************************
File name collisions
**********************************************

We decided our resolution for filname collision would be to terminate connection in the event that a collision occured and prompt the user that a file with the same name is already being written to.

**********************************************
TO RUN CLIENT TESTING SCRIPT: RUNS ON PORT 12040
**********************************************
	
	I have created a testing script that will run multiple clients at once, this script will have seperate clients send different files to the server.

	FOR LOCALHOST:
		If you are testing on local host, type "python localhost:portnumber"

	FOR LINUX.SOCS.UOGUELPH.CA:
		If you are testing on the University's Linux terminals, "type python script.py servername" where servername is the name of the server. Some examples of SOCS servers are ginny.socs.uoguelph.ca , fred.socs.uoguelph.ca , george.socs.uoguelph.ca. This script has been created to make grading easier for you but if for any reason you are having issues using it, please feel free to message me! :)
